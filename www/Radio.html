The Beach Boys, Gary Lewis & The Playboys, The Byrds, The Mamas & The Papas, The Carpenters, The Monkees, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. were just some of the artists that used Hal.', 'A little water never hurt anything. The main drumset used on all of the STAX hits was the victim of a leaky roof. You can see the watermark in the bottom of the bassdrum.', 'When it came time to record "Lay Lady Lay", Bob Dylan asked session drummer Kenny Buttrey to play bongos and cowbell.  Kenny didnt have any bongo stands, so he asked the janitor to hold them while they tracked the song.  The janitor had just started working at the studio...his name was Kris Kristofferson.', 'Hank Williams cut "Your Cheatin Heart" at the end of a session.  They had 20 minutes left and he played half of it to the band and they rolled tape.  The band nailed it in one take and they left.  Hank died the next day and the band never got to play the song live. The version you hear today is the ONE TIME the band performed the tune.', 'Luther Perkins played guitar for Johnny Cash and The Tennessee Two until his death in 1968.  What few people know is that his hobby was knitting.  Luther passed his time on the road making sweaters and gloves for bandmates and friends. THAT is rock n roll. Check out the Johnny Cash display to see some of his work.', 'Engineer Tom Dowd was involved in the Manhattan Project before going on to work on some of the biggest albums in Rock n Roll.  He produced Ray Charles, Bobby Darin, Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Aretha Franklin and Lynyrd Skynyrd.', 'Chad Smith of The Red Hot Chili Peppers is also an established studio musician.  He has appeared on records by The Avett Brothers, ZZ Top, The Dixie Chicks, Kid Rock, George Clinton and Brandi Carlile.', 'Hal Blaine got hired to play drums for Frank Sinatra because of a squeaky drumset. Sinatra fired him for ruining a session and Hal got the gig. Blaine custom fitted his drumset with rubber grommets.  He said he didnt want any metal on metal anywhere on the set.  This is the set we have on display in the museum.', 'Nashville drummer Buddy Harmon played on over 17,000 sessions.  You have heard his work.'];
